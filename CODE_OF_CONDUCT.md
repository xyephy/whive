WHIVE PROTOCOL CODE OF CONDUCT
=====================================

* Last updated 23 January 2020

“Acting according to this Code of Conduct is vital to the success of the Whive Protocol.”

1: ABOUT WHIVE
----------------

Whive, is a blockchain protocol that extends the Bitcoin Blockchain through enabling Trustless Rewards for Engineering Sustainable Solutions.

The Whive community has set out to build a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol and Auxiliary Chain(AuxChain) that will allow for building applications that trustlessly reward sustainable solutions.

The Whive Protocol is built with game-theory that rewards machines operating in regions in the World with a high solar reliability.

Thus, the protocol will incentivize engineers in the developing World to contribute to developing sustainable solutions to challenges facing their community using the following Engineering disciplines:

Community Engineering + Software Engineering + Protocol Engineering

The Whive protocol will be supported by a suite of software tools built to incentivize multiple third-party individuals and institutions to collaborate together to execute and achieve this vision.

The Whive protocol is designed to unlock the potential of sustainable resources such as Solar Energy by enabling a distributed economy that is interoperable with the mainstream economy.

The background for this project is from a published research paper report by BitHub Africa the Founding contributor to the Whive protocol titled “The African Blockchain Opportunity”, 2017.

The Whive Protocol is being built, tested and deployed by a community of individuals and organizations around the World. The Whive Protocol is designed for utility and not speculative investment and therefore should accrue value as its Community effect and active use continue to grow.

This code of conduct guides the development, testing, deployment and use of the Whive Protocol as well as the conduct of the Whive Founders, Contributors, Developers and other involved stakeholders.
