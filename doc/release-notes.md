How to Upgrade
==============

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

<<<<<<< HEAD
If your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.
=======
Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated.  Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

<<<<<<< HEAD
Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).
=======
Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not
recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.
>>>>>>> upstream/0.18

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

<<<<<<< HEAD
From 0.17.0 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't
support versions of macOS older than 10.10.

Notable changes
===============

`listtransactions` label support
--------------------------------

The `listtransactions` RPC `account` parameter which was deprecated in 0.17.0
and renamed to `dummy` has been un-deprecated and renamed again to `label`.

When bitcoin is configured with the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting, specifying
a label/account/dummy argument will return both outgoing and incoming
transactions. Without the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting, it will only return
incoming transactions (because it used to be possible to create transactions
spending from specific accounts, but this is no longer possible with labels).

When `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` is set, it's possible to pass the empty string ""
to list transactions that don't have any label. Without
`-deprecatedrpc=accounts`, passing the empty string is an error because returning
only non-labeled transactions is not generally useful behavior and can cause
confusion.

=======
From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is
built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than
10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.

In addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's
pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V
platform.

If you are using the `systemd` unit configuration file located at
`contrib/init/bitcoind.service`, it has been changed to use
`/var/lib/bitcoind` as the data directory instead of
`~bitcoin/.bitcoin`. When switching over to the new configuration file,
please make sure that the filesystem on which `/var/lib/bitcoind` will
exist has enough space (check using `df -h /var/lib/bitcoind`), and
optionally copy over your existing data directory. See the [systemd init
file section](#systemd-init-file) for more details.

Known issues
============

Wallet GUI
----------

For advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and
(2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control
input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when
switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended
not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.

Notable changes
===============

<<<<<<< HEAD

0.18.x change log
=================

>>>>>>> upstream/0.18
=======
New RPCs
--------

- `getbalances` returns an object with all balances (`mine`,
  `untrusted_pending` and `immature`). Please refer to the RPC help of
  `getbalances` for details. The new RPC is intended to replace
  `getunconfirmedbalance` and the balance fields in `getwalletinfo`, as well as
  `getbalance`. The old calls may be removed in a future version.

Updated RPCs
------------

Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the
Low-level Changes section below.

* The `sendmany` RPC had an argument `minconf` that was not well specified and
  would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's coin selection would succeed.
  The `sendtoaddress` RPC never had this check, so to normalize the behavior,
  `minconf` is now ignored in `sendmany`. If the coin selection does not
  succeed due to missing coins, it will still throw an RPC error. Be reminded
  that coin selection is influenced by the `-spendzeroconfchange`,
  `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains`
  command line arguments.


Low-level changes
=================

Configuration
------------

* An error is issued where previously a warning was issued when a setting in
  the config file was specified in the default section, but not overridden for
  the selected network. This change takes only effect if the selected network
  is not mainnet.

Wallet
------

- When in pruned mode, a rescan that was triggered by an `importwallet`,
  `importpubkey`, `importaddress`, or `importprivkey` RPC will only fail when
  blocks have been pruned. Previously it would fail when `-prune` has been set.
  This change allows to set `-prune` to a high value (e.g. the disk size) and
  the calls to any of the import RPCs would fail when the first block is
  pruned.
