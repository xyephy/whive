Whive Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Whive Core is the original Whive client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Whive transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Whive Core, visit [whive.org](https://whive.org/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Whive Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/cranapay-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/whived` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run whive-qt.exe.
